# About vault

vault is a place for students to ask questions about the world they live in,
and answer them through independent quantitative analysis.

Created as part of the
[Reach for the Stars](http://gk12.ciera.northwestern.edu/) program, vault
aims to provide students the structure, community, and mentoring needed 
to make this happen.
